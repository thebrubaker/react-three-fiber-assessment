# React Three Fiber + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup for a React Three Fiber project. It
includes the following packages:

- TypeScript
- React Three Fiber /  Drei
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn Components
- ESLint

This repository assumes you have Node v20+ installed.

## Tech Assessment Instructions

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your proficiency in manipulating 3D models, applying textures, and working with UI elements and shaders within a React environment using React Three Fiber. You will be asked to perform several tasks on a live coding call where you can share your screen.

## Preparation

1. **System Requirements:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed, preferably version 20, as it is required by the project.
   - You may use any code editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode, Atom).
   - Access to the internet and the ability to share your screen during the assessment.

2. **Repository Setup:**
   - Please clone the repository from GitHub:
     `git clone https://github.com/thebrubaker/react-three-fiber-assessment`
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     `cd react-three-fiber-assessment`
   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     `npm install`
   - Start the application to ensure everything is set up correctly:
     `npm start`

3. **During the Assessment:**
   - You are free to use any tools or online resources, including Google and AI assistance, to aid in your coding during the assessment.
   - The tasks will be presented to you at the beginning of the call. They will involve:
     - **Model Manipulation:** Adjusting positions, rotations, or scales of 3D models.
     - **Texture Application:** Changing and applying new textures to models.
     - **UI Elements:** Enhancing or modifying user interface components.
     - **Shaders:** Demonstrating basic knowledge in shader programming.

4. **Screen Sharing:**
   - You will be required to share your screen throughout the assessment. Please ensure your internet connection is stable enough to support screen sharing without significant lag.

5. **Interview Etiquette:**
   - Feel free to ask clarifying questions at any time.
   - Discuss your thought process openly as you work through the tasks. This discussion is as important as the final code.

## End of Assessment

- You will have a chance to discuss and explain your solutions.
- We are interested in your approach and problem-solving strategies, so detailed explanations are encouraged.
- Feedback will be provided at the end of the session.

We look forward to seeing your coding skills in action. Good luck!
